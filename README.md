# BlackJack AI Dealer and Player
This application is a simple implementation of the popular card game "Blackjack" in python. Here are the rules:

1. The goal of the game is to have a hand that is worth more than the dealer's hand without going over 21 points.
2. Cards are worth their face value, with face cars (jacks, kings, queens) worth 10 points and aces worth either 1 or 11 (player's choice).
3. The player can request more cards (aka "hit") to try and reach 21 points, but if 21 points is exceeded, the player loses (aka "bust").
4. After the player's turn is over, the dealer will continue to hit until their hand is worth at least 17 points.
5. If the dealer busts, the player automatically wins.
6. If the dealer's hand is worth more than the player's hand without going over 21, the player loses.
7. If the dealer and player have the same number of points on hand, the game is a tie (aka "push").
